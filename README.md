Assessment3 Final Interactive Media Project (Java in Processing)

***Task***: Create a software tool that records live interaction inputs (any selection or combination of mouse, keyboard, image, video, audio, gesture etc.) as time series data (at least 20 samples of recording, 
but more likely hundreds) before transforming the data into a static or dynamic graphic, visual, auditory or haptic form for one or more media of your choice. You should provide feedback in some way when 
the interaction is being recorded to the time series, as well as presenting a final form that represents the accumulated interaction inputs. You should provide a number of parameters by which 
the transformation may be customised. Your interaction inputs can be from any interaction input available to you. You may create the output form in a wide variety of media including typography, 
2D or 3D drawing, sound, haptic stimuli, 3D objects, print media or any other media, all of which may be synthesised entirely, or alternatively derived from existing media through processing.


**Info:** "*Processing* is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and 
visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping"
